# üçï Fast React Pizza Co.

This is a simple React application where users can order one or more pizzas from a dynamically loaded menu. The app is designed to be user-friendly, requiring minimal user input to place an order.

## üöÄ Features

- **Dynamic Pizza Menu**: The pizza menu is loaded from an API, allowing for changes in the available options without modifying the frontend.
- **Cart Functionality**: Users can add multiple pizzas to their cart before placing an order.
- **Simple Order Process**: Users only need to provide their name, phone number, and address to place an order.
- **GPS Location**: If possible, the app will automatically provide the user's GPS location to facilitate easier delivery.
- **Priority Order**: Users can mark their order as "priority" for an additional 20% of the cart price, even after the order has been placed.
- **Order Submission**: Orders are sent via a POST request to the API, including the user's data and selected pizzas.
- **Unique Order ID**: Each order receives a unique ID, allowing users to look up their order later.
- **No Payment Processing**: Payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is needed within the app.
